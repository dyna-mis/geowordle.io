Generated File Format (a modified version of the DIMACS FORMAT)

##Descriptions
All the instances used in experiments are in this DIMACS-style format. The DIMACS format is
a widely used format to test and compare SAT and graph related algorithms. A instance file contains
the description of an instance using three types of lines:
1. Comment line: Comment lines give information about the instances for human readers, like the
author of the file or related works. A comment line starts with a lower-case character c and
will be ignored by programs:
c # this is an example of the comment line #
The instances generated by this generator include information about generator engine (UNIFORM/GAUSSIAN/..) and further informations about the underlying model.
2. Problem line: The problem line appears exactly once in each DIMACS format file. The
problem line is signified by a lower-case character p. The problem line
in its DIMACS file is:
p <width> <height> <point_number> <color_number>

3. Point Descriptor: An colored point (x, y, c)  is described in an point Descriptor:
<x> <y> <c> 0
* Now we a point dexriptor line ends with 0. We keep this convention for possible extention to weighted case
